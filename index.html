        <p>Hi! My name is Gustavo. I love food! <br> I would consider myself a foodie, I am always willing to try new cuisines. <br> As much as I love to try new food, I also enjoy to cook new foods as well. <br> At 17 years old I got my first job as a waiter at a family-owned Thai restaurant. <strong>Lotus Garden</strong>. <br> After trying Pad Thai for the first time I knew there was no going back to regular fast food combo meals considered <em>fancy</em>. <br> All jokes aside, it started my curiosity for trying different cuisines. I felt I have been missing out on good food for the first quarter of my life. I want to share three of my favorite recipes I like to make at home.</p>
